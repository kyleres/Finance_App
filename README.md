# Flyte
Where your investments take flyte

## Introduction
For our first project, we decided to build a finance app that allows the user to search for data about specific stocks. Users can search through a list of common and popular stocks and see detailed information about their daily performance as well as any news articles that may be of interest to the investor.

## Concept
When were thinking about our group project, we wanted to build an app that has real world practical use and would showcase our individual skills as developers. We decided to make a finance app because it provides many options for APIs we can use. It was also an idea that we can apply in many different ways. After some more consideration, we decided to do an app that displays specific information about the user's chosen stocks so that he/she can take a quick look at the market befor making their investments. The app was designed to be easy to use and understand so that both new and professional investors can check the status of their stocks with ease.
### User Story
```
AS A small-time or big-time investor
I WANT to see the performance of my stocks
SO THAT I can plan my investments wisely
```

## Process
Basic Parts:
1. A search bar that would allow the user to search for a stock
2. A section to save the user's history
3. A chart which displays current and historical stock data for the current date
4. A news section where articles specific to the stock can be displayed

Team Roles:
1. Front end - Bikram, Jill (HTML, CSS, etc.)
2. Back end - Alex, Kyle, Zaki (JS, APIs, etc.)

Technologies:
1. [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) framework for layout and styling
    * [Rally](https://material.io/design/material-studies/rally.html) as a study on app design
2. [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) for search bar options
3. [IEX Cloud API](https://iexcloud.io/) to generate stock chart data
4. [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display stock chart data
5. [Yahooo Finance News API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1?endpoint=5c3da178e4b0cc6cdc0ed65f) to display basic profile data and news specific to the user's stock
